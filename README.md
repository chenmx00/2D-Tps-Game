# 2D-Tps-Game
This game is based and modified from one of my school project at UC Berkeley.
The generation of each maze, hallway and rooms are totally psuedorandom, 
and if the player input the same seed when loading the game second time, he should see the same world from the save point.
To see more features, look at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=As9s1c5X7GU for demo.
